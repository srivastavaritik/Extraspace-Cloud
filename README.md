A cloud where one can create folders, and upload files and links. It helps in keeping all the documents, files, and links together in one place and saves some space on the personal device and much more.

## Brief

## Main Features

● DATA SECURITY :
We are now working on making our application decentralized with the help of blockchain to make it secure.

● Crypto Wallet :
Users will be able to track and store their crypto transactions in our application which will guarantee data security to users.
(In fact, we are now even deployed on Blockchain)

● Decentralized :
Since the application will be decentralized, there is no chance of data breach or privacy/security issues.
